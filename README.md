# ECDSA Signature Server

This is a simple REST API written in Rust using the [warp](https://docs.rs/warp/) library used for serving ECDSA signatures to prevent automation software from purchasing NFTs in bulk.

Heavily inspired by [warp's todo example API](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/blob/master/examples/todos.rs).
